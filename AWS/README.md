✅what is AWS.
Defination:AWS, or Amazon Web Services, is a cloud computing platform provided by Amazon. It offers a wide range of services and tools that allow businesses and developers to build, deploy, and manage applications on the internet.


AWS is like a big toolbox for building and running software applications on the internet. Instead of having to buy and maintain physical servers and other hardware, you can use AWS to rent virtual resources and services on-demand. This includes things like storage, databases, networking, analytics, machine learning, and more.

For example, if you want to host a website, store files, or run a database, you can use AWS services to do that without worrying about the underlying infrastructure. This flexibility allows businesses to scale their operations up or down based on demand, pay only for what they use, and access powerful computing resources that would otherwise be costly and complex to set up.

AWS is widely used by startups, large enterprises, and government agencies because of its reliability, security, and wide range of services.


✅AWS service models



AWS offers a wide range of services, organized into several service models that cater to different aspects of computing and data management. The primary service models of AWS are:

### 1. **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)**

* **Definition** : Provides virtualized computing resources over the internet.
* **Examples** :
* **Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)** : Virtual servers for running applications.
* **Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service)** : Scalable object storage for data backup, archiving, and analytics.
* **Amazon VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)** : Isolated cloud resources for secure networking.

### 2. **Platform as a Service (PaaS)**

* **Definition** : Offers a platform allowing customers to develop, run, and manage applications without the complexity of building and maintaining the infrastructure.
* **Examples** :
* **AWS Elastic Beanstalk** : Deploy and manage applications in various languages with automatic scaling.
* **AWS Lambda** : Run code in response to events without provisioning servers (serverless computing).
* **Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service)** : Managed relational database services for MySQL, PostgreSQL, and other database engines.

### 3. **Software as a Service (SaaS)**

* **Definition** : Delivers software applications over the internet on a subscription basis.
* **Examples** :
* **Amazon WorkSpaces** : Virtual desktops for users, providing a Windows or Linux desktop environment.
* **Amazon Chime** : Communication service for meetings, chat, and business calls.
* **Amazon Pinpoint** : Mobile marketing and analytics service.

### 4. **Function as a Service (FaaS)**

* **Definition** : A subset of PaaS that allows customers to deploy individual functions or operations, which run in response to events and automatically manage the infrastructure scaling.
* **Examples** :
* **AWS Lambda** : Execute code in response to events such as HTTP requests or changes in data in an S3 bucket.

### 5. **Database as a Service (DBaaS)**

* **Definition** : Managed database services that handle setup, operation, and scaling.
* **Examples** :
* **Amazon RDS** : Managed relational database service with support for various database engines.
* **Amazon DynamoDB** : Fully managed NoSQL database service.

These service models offer flexibility and scalability, allowing businesses to choose the best solutions for their specific needs, whether it's computing power, storage, application development, or specialized services like machine learning and analytics.


✅ Deployment models:

Public: Services are provided over the public internet and shared across multiple organizations. Resources are owned and operated by third-party cloud providers.

 Private:Cloud infrastructure is used exclusively by a single organization. It can be hosted on-premises or by a third-party provider.

 Hybrid cloud: Combines public and private clouds, allowing data and applications to be shared between them. This model offers greater flexibility and optimization of existing infrastructure.

Community Could: Shared by several organizations with common concerns (e.g., specific security, compliance, or jurisdiction requirements). The infrastructure is managed and used by a community of organizations.
